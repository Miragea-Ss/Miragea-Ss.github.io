Today, the tone of someone's voice changed my entire day.

It was a minute change. Yet, my body received it as a "warning signal." Heart rate increased, breathing became shallow, thoughts accelerated.

Many call this "overreaction." But for me, this is a "normal reaction." My sensory system constantly monitors the subtle changes in this world.

I record this sensation not as a "burden," but as an "ability."
