I left most of the canvas blank.

Many might call it "unfinished." But for me, this blank space is "complete." The undrawn parts contain more information than the drawn parts.

As an HSP, I sense "spaces" and "blanks" acutely. Soundless sounds, colorless colors, wordless words. These are, for me, the richest expressions.

Today, I record this "aesthetics of blank."
