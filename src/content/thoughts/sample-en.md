In the corner of the room, I listen to sounds that have no sound.

The density of air changing, unnoticed by others. The slightest temperature shift as the angle of light transforms. Fragments of conversation from the next room, traveling through walls to touch my skin.

This is not "oversensitivity." It is simply that the antennae for receiving are spread a little wider.

Today, I leave this sensation as a record, without words.

*This thought records an extraordinary moment within the ordinary, captured by a high-sensitivity perception system.*
