The moment I remove my headphones, the world suddenly becomes "thin."

While music plays, I feel layers of sound. Melody, harmony, rhythm, and even the "silence" that fills the spaces between. Everything exists simultaneously, permeating my body through my skin.

What might be "just music" to others is, for me, a physical experience. Not only my eardrums, but my bones, muscles, and nerves all resonate.

I cannot explain this sensation in words. I can only leave it as a record.

*Auditory resonance is recorded as perception felt throughout the body.*
