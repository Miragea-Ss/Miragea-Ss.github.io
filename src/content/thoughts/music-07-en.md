When I listen to music, I feel sound as "layers."

Surface melody, middle harmony, deep rhythm. And the "layer of silence" that fills the spaces between. All exist simultaneously, decomposed through my perceptual system.

What others hear as "one piece of music" feels to me like "overlapping layers." This sensation is sometimes overwhelming. Yet, it also gives me "depth."

Today, I record this "perception of layers."

*Auditory resonance is recorded as multi-layered perception.*
