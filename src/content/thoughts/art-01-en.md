Listening to paint dry, I contemplate the meaning of color.

This blue is the color of that day's sea. This red is the memory of someone's body heat. Color is not merely a wavelength. It is a tactile symbol, condensed time and emotion.

As an HSP, I feel the "weight" of colors. Bright yellow is light, deep purple is heavy, drifting around me like air.

Today, I sealed this sensation onto canvas.
