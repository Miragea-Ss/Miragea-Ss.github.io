The creative process is not a straight line.

An idea emerges. I try to give it form. Midway, something feels "wrong." I stop. Wait. Look from another angle. Begin again.

This "space" might actually be the most important. Not the finished piece, but the "dissonance" or "incompleteness" felt during the process becomes the seed for the next work.

As an HSP, I sense this "space" acutely. I receive the subtle disharmonies that many miss as "signals."

Today, I record this process.
