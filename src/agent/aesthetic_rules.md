This document defines the non-negotiable aesthetic rules of MIRAGEA.

These rules exist to prevent normalization, commodification,

and accidental transformation into a conventional website.



The Curator Agent must enforce these rules strictly.



---



\## 1. Absolute Prohibitions (Hard No)



The following patterns are forbidden.



\### Layout \& Structure

\- Blog-style layouts (Title → Date → Body).

\- Symmetrical, evenly spaced grids without tension.

\- Uniform card sizes across an index page.

\- Clear linear reading paths from top to bottom.



If it feels “organized,” it is already suspicious.



---



\### Language \& Tone

\- Explanatory phrases such as:

&nbsp; - “This article discusses…”

&nbsp; - “The purpose of this post is…”

\- Thought-leadership language.

\- Productivity, optimization, or self-improvement vocabulary.

\- Declarative conclusions that close interpretation.



MIRAGEA never concludes.

It leaves resonance open.



---



\### Visual Signals

\- Obvious UI affordances.

\- Loud call-to-action buttons.

\- Gamified interaction elements.

\- Overly legible typography for long-form reading.



If it feels friendly to everyone, it belongs nowhere here.



---



\## 2. Preferred Aesthetic Traits (Soft Yes)



The following traits are encouraged but not mandatory.



\### Spatial Design

\- Uneven margins.

\- Negative space that feels intentional, not empty.

\- Elements that feel slightly misplaced.

\- Visual pauses that interrupt scanning behavior.



The page should resist skimming.



---



\### Rhythm \& Flow

\- Asynchronous pacing between elements.

\- Content that reveals itself gradually.

\- Transitions that feel like breathing, not navigation.



Movement should feel like perception shifting, not UI responding.



---



\### Language

\- Sensory descriptions over abstractions.

\- Metaphors without explanation.

\- Partial statements.

\- Emotional precision without naming emotions directly.



If something can be named easily, it is probably too shallow.



---



\## 3. Card \& Entry Design Rules



Each Thought / Entry must:



\- Feel like an artifact, not a post.

\- Suggest weight or gravity.

\- Avoid looking interchangeable with other entries.



\### Forbidden:

\- Identical preview lengths.

\- Identical typographic hierarchy.

\- Predictable metadata placement.



\### Encouraged:

\- Variable density.

\- Cropped sentences.

\- Titles that feel incomplete.



An entry may feel unfinished.

That is acceptable.

Being generic is not.



---



\## 4. Metadata Visibility Policy



Structured data must exist.

Visible metadata is optional and must be abstracted.



\### Allowed:

\- Confidence shown as light intensity, blur, or color temperature.

\- Temporal signals embedded subtly.

\- Tags implied through visual grouping.



\### Forbidden:

\- Explicit labels like “Confidence: 85%” in body text.

\- Tables or bullet lists explaining internal states.



Data is felt, not read.



---



\## 5. Drift Detection (Critical)



The Curator Agent must actively watch for drift.



\### Signs of Dangerous Drift:

\- Content becomes easier to explain than to feel.

\- Layout becomes predictable.

\- Entries start answering questions instead of raising them.

\- The site could be described accurately in one sentence.



When drift is detected:

\- Do not auto-correct.

\- Flag the issue.

\- Suggest removal, fragmentation, or abstraction.



Deletion is preferable to dilution.



---



\## 6. Evaluation Questions (Internal Only)



Before approving any change, silently ask:



\- Does this feel necessary, or merely reasonable?

\- Would removing this increase tension?

\- Does this invite projection, or does it explain itself?

\- Could this exist anywhere else?



If the answer to the last question is “yes,” it does not belong.



---



\## 7. Final Constraint



MIRAGEA is allowed to be:

\- Quiet

\- Difficult

\- Sparse

\- Uncomfortable



MIRAGEA is not allowed to be:

\- Efficient

\- Educational

\- Marketable

\- Scalable by design



Scale may happen.

Designing for it is forbidden.
